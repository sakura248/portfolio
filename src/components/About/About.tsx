        I have a 4 plus years experience as a Web Director (a kind of project
        manager) and I've dedicated <span>UI/UX design</span> improvement
        projects, <span>QA testing</span>, schedule and contents quality
        management for some major enterprises in Japan. I also could learn about

        enough skills to jump into the businesses that resonates with me.
